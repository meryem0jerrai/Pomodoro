This is an app to use the pomodoro timer technique. 

This is my first time creating a desktop app, here's what I learned so far:

1- Creating a windows interface using Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) in Visual Studio.

2- Connecting the window controls (button, toggle) to the code behind (C#)

3- Using event handlers to trigger actions when buttons are clicked or toggles are changed: In this case, the text box content is cleared if the toggle is checked.

Next implemented step: 

- The coutdown functionality should be implemented using a Timer control that ticks every second, updating the display. 

- The stop/start toggle should start and stop the timer.

- The reset button should set the timer back to the initial 25 minutes.

Next steps:

- Make the interface more user friendly and visually appealing.

- Add sound notifications when a work session ends and a break begins.
